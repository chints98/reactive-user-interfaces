### Design Systems

React is a great tool for making reusable interface components for the web. The term 'design system' is often used to describe how companies bundle up web components based on their visual language that can be used across the organization. A lot of React-based component libraries exist:

* [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com/) - A React library based on Google's Material Design principles.
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) - A React library following the Ant Design specification.
* [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) - A React library integrating Semantic UI.
* [Shopify Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/) - Shopify's Design System

You can use any of these with `create-react-app`.

* **[material-ui](material-ui)**. An app using the Material UI components.
