### Midterm Feedback

I am really proud of the progress you all made in the first 6 weeks of this class. You have been coding React for only 5 weeks, and you all managed to make a functional UI that demonstrated the basic React functionality that we have learned so far.

In this class, I will highlight some of the recurring themes that popped up in most of your user interfaces, and how I would have solved it differently. This feedback will be both visual and technical, but will mostly focus on key relationships in your graphic layout:

* **Position**. Does the position of your elements make sense from the user's point of view? Are you _aligning_ your elements so the user can make sense of the layout? Do you have proper _whitespace_ to make it easier to quickly get a sense of the layout?

* **Size**. Are your elements sized correctly? Are the most important items larger than less important items?

* **Color**. Do you use color contrast to clarify the layout and distinguish groups of elements from others? Do you cut down on unnecessary use of color that distracts the user?

* **Typography**. Do you use different type style to signal differences between data points? Do you keep the amount of different typefaces to a minimum?

All in all, this boils down to whether your user interface signals the _intent_ of the elements by using the variables above. The first step towards a good interface is to think of these variables as functional rather than aesthetic. Now, let's take a look at some of your user interfaces and what I would change.
