## Assignment for Monday

Your assignment for Monday is to do competitor research and user stories for your final, exactly like you did for your midterm a few weeks back. If you can't remember, [these are my notes from the class](../week-5). Please post the results of your research on the documentation blog and be ready to discuss your findings in class.
