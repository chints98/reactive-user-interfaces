# Reactive User Interfaces

React.js has quickly become a favored tool for making interactive user interfaces for the web and beyond. One reason for this success is that React.js introduces a one-way data flow model that drastically simplifies UI development. This class takes a deep dive into the field of UI development by focusing on what makes a React.js interface different than one built with jQuery: We will look at the React component hierarchy, the JSX templating system, and how to load and display dynamic data from API’s. The goal of the class is to teach students how to design and build beautiful web interfaces that respond to user’s behavior, and at the end of the class, students will have built several functional UI’s in React.js. Students must have taken Communications Lab (or have equivalent experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to register for this class.
