# Reactive User Interfaces

This is the code repository for the Reactive User Interfaces class taught at NYU Shanghai's Interactive Media Arts program. All examples have been created with `create-react-app`.

### Installing `create-react-app`

Perform these steps to install `create-react-app` on your computer:

1. First make sure that you are running the [latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Run `npm install -g create-react-app` from your terminal.

### Creating a new app

Perform these steps to generate a new React app inside of your class repository.

1. Move into your class folder by running `cd PATH` in your terminal. You need to replace `PATH` with the actual name of your folder. If it is in `Documents`, this would be `cd ~/Documents/reactive-user-interfaces`.
1. Run `create-react-app PROJECTNAME` where you replace `PROJECTNAME` with the name of your project. For a simple test project, you can run `create-react-app test`.
1. Now follow the instructions provided by the generator. You will need to `cd` into the new folder and run `npm start` to see the app in your browser.
