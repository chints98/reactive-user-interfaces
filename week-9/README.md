### Assignment for Monday

Pick an idea for your final project and post a short paragraph on the class blog. The paragraph needs to state which user interfaces you're building, who you are building it for, and what makes your UI different than what currently exists. You will be paper prototyping this idea in class on Monday. Note that this blog post does not need to have actual design/competitor research. We will do that in the following weeks.
Once you have picked your idea, you cannot change it. The implementation may change, but the core focus should not.
