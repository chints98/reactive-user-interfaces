# UI Complexity - React

This example demonstrates the same simple UI but in React.

## Benefits

* **All the problems from the former examples are gone**. We no longer have to reach into the DOM to create HTML elements. React does this for us, and it even diffs the new HTML with the old HTML and only updates what changed.

* **Nice component structure**. Our code is split into nice files, and bundled together when run in the browser.

* **Automatic updates in browser**. Just save your file and the app reruns in the browser.

* **Great error messages**. The web developer console will give you nice error messages when you make a mistake.

* **React Developer Tools**. You can inspect your React components directly from the web inspector if you install React Developer Tools.
