# Week 2

This week we will talk about the complexity of writing user interfaces in pure JavaScript. This folder holds three examples of the same UI built with different techniques:

1. **[ui-complexity-dom-manipulation](ui-complexity-dom-manipulation)**. A simple user interface written in pure JavaScript. Please consult the README.

1. **[ui-complexity-render-function](ui-complexity-render-function)**. The same user interface written to render HTML elements in JavaScript. Please consult the README.

1. **[ui-complexity-react](ui-complexity-react)**. The same user interface written in React. Please consult the README.
